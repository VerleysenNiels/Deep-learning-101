# Deep-learning-101
Repository following along with my blog series about deep learning on medium.

- [Deep learning from scratch: Neurons, Layers & Activations](https://medium.com/@niels.verleysen/deep-learning-from-scratch-neurons-layers-activations-121f61849ba2)
- [Deep learning from scratch: Backpropagation](https://medium.com/@niels.verleysen/deep-learning-from-scratch-2-backpropagation-dae422b7ca7b)

To run these notebooks you need to have python, jupyter notebook, numpy and matplotlib installed.
I am using python 3.6 and the jupyter extensions for VScode.
Matplotlib and numpy can be installed through pip.
